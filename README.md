# **TEXTURE LIBRARY RENDERER**

<br>
<img src="./README_imgs/rends.JPG" width="944" height="600"><br>

This program was created out of a problem I had of not being able to easily view texture maps I accumulated over time.<br>
The number of assets had increased to the point I didn't know what I had that I would end<br>
up purchasing a texture asset I already owned because I was too lazy to check for it in my library.<br><br>
The solution I came up with was to automate the rendering process of all the textures then create html files with the renders arranged<br>
according to categories that I can browse easily, I also automated a large part of this (more details below).<br>
I had absolutely no idea how I was going to pull it off, I used C++ for no reason except that's what I am familiar with, I am currently still a C++ beginner though.<br><br>
I hope this program will also be useful to others with a same or similar challenge,<br>

In order to use the program in your own system you can take a look at the code and comments.<br>
It is best when your own texture assets library is arranged in folders and categories in a manner similar to the image below, which shows how the asset *Marble10* has been filed.<br>
You will also notice the texture map names are named according to conventional methods. I added to my code most of the conventional texture map names that are used in the 3D industry.<br>
If some are missing or you have some that are named in a non common way, you can add them to the program code yourself.<br><br>

Just to note; if everything compiles correctly you should see seven new files added to the main folder.<br>

I've unnecessarily tried to over comment so that even those that aren't well versed with C++ syntax can know what's going on,<br>
but I haven't explained absolutely everything with comments though.<br>
I wrote and compiled the source code in Visual Studio 2022 in a Windows 10 system with MSVC using the C++17 language standard.<br><br>
For compiling with g++ or to use the source code without using Visual Studio you can check this article :<br>

The filesystem module may not work with g++ (in Linux or Windows) but there's some solutions on these articles:<br>

However, there may be some more incompatibilities with g++ on Linux that I'm not aware of.<br>

## **Texture Library Explorer (not in this repo)**
<br>
The texture library explorer I created looks like this<br>

When you click on *view* a modal pops up with a closer look and the path to the asset as the title<br>

It was built using Bootstrap 5 and some basic CSS, I automated a lot of it since the library was too big to code entirely manually.<br>
The code for the library explorer is very specific to what I needed so I don't intend on adding it to my Github but<br>
if you're interested in the code just let me know (one way is to send a message on the issues part of this repo)<br><br>

## **Overview of my logic building this program (no need to read on!)**

<br>
This section serves as a record for me to know exactly what I was thinking when I reference this in the future.<br><br>

I required the program to recursively iterate through the relevant folders that contained the texture map assets and then save the results to .txt files, <br>
those .txt files will serve as logs and lists that the rest of the program will use to search for texture maps for rendering, use as a watermark label for the renders and keeping check of what is rendered.<br><br>
Since I knew I had some folders I didn't want included, I passed each iteration result through a function that would only let it pass if the folder had a normal map, as seen in <br>
the function SearchNormal from line 196 of the source code.<br>
On my personal program I had to add more `KeywordCheckxx` variables to exclude folders that had normal maps but I didn't want them rendered out.<br>
I also had to do the same on the `SearchAlbedo()` function, your individual case needs will vary so you may find<br>
you will have to add or remove `KeywordCheckxx` variables with associated if statements<br><br>
The last requirement was for the program to create a python automation script that Blender would use to load the texture maps on to a material,<br>
load a .txt file with the name of the current asset being rendered (this file will be used as  a watermark for the rendered image), <br>
then save the rendered image with the name from the watermark.<br>
Then I also needed a .bat file that would handle the execution and exit of the Blender and python script file on each loop. This .bat file would run Blender in background mode.<br>
Though obvious, I think I should mention each time the while loop runs, the python script, watermark text file and batch file are all being overwritten.<br>
I have read a lot on why `std::system()` shouldn't be used but I didn't have the time to figure out a better alternative to run Blender from within my program.<br>
After all was done, I had to create a separate program that would create a texture library explorer/browser that I could easily view the assets I had <br>
and browse by category instead of searching through about 500 different renders.<br>
This one ended up being harder than I thought and needed some manual fixing after automating the process.<br>
